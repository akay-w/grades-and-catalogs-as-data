German Idealism began as a response to Immanuel Kant's transcendental idealism and critique of the European Enlightenment. The course highlights the critiques of Kant's idealism and the innovations in idealism offered by major figures such as Jacobi, Reinhold, Fichte, Schelling, Schiller, Goethe, and Hölderlin. Although we will acknowledge the various transformations in epistemology and metaphysics during this post-Kantian era, the course will focus on these historical figures' philosophical debates and resolutions on the meaning of Nature, human consciousness, Spirit, the role of art and poetry in moral development, romanticism, and reason versus faith.    \n",

In addition, students, together with their on site supervisor and faculty sponsor, will develop a list of objectives for the specific internship, maintain a log and reflective journal, meet weekly with the faculty member in person or virtually, submit an academic paper at the conclusion of the internship related to their internship work, and summarize their activities orally in Spanish for their faculty supervisor or for a larger audience as a scholarly presentation.     \n",

Their storytelling is often novelistic but their standards of evidence are those of the historian. They confront distinctive questions: What lives are worth writing? What is the relationship between the individual and society? What rules govern the relationship between biographers and their subjects? How has the art of biography changed over the centuries, and what forces have driven those changes? \\n\\nIn this course, we'll read both notable biographies and the critical literature on biography. We will apprentice ourselves to leading biographers to understand the craft, and we will develop the research tools necessary for uncovering and narrating lives that illuminate our world. The course will be workshop-based with students sharing their creative work, exploring prose techniques, and offering peer critique.    \n",

       "1637  In a diverse society, intentional dialogue about social group identities (i.e. race, class, gender, religion, etc.) is needed to facilitate understanding, collaboration, and social change. In this intergroup dialogue course, students will participate in semi-structured face-to-face meetings where participants from diverse social identity groups explore personal and group commonalities and differences; locate these different identities and experiences within societal systems of power, privilege, and oppression; and find ways to work collaboratively to build more inclusive communities. Drawing on research in the fields of sociology, psychology, and philosophy (among others), students will explore group experiences in a variety of social and institutional contexts. Students will participate in exercises that will be debriefed in class and in weekly journals. In addition to assigned readings, classroom interactions will be a site of learning and exploration. The goal is to create a setting in which students engage in open and constructive dialogue, learning, and exploration concerning issues of intergroup relations, conflict, and community.    \n",
